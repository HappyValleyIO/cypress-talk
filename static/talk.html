# Love of SPA's

* Started using VueJS almost everyday
* *Loved* it passionately
* Felt amazingly simple and dynamic and productive and wonderful
* But...

---

## Trouble in paradise (or Pain in the SPA's)

* SPA unit testing was better-ish in that it let me define actual behaviour
* Component based testing was *fine*, but still "behaviour of code"
* Tests involved a fair bit of learning to test effectively
* Build tools caused pain
* Code review wasn't very pleasant

```javascript

import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import MyComponent from './MyComponent.vue'

const wrapper = shallowMount(MyComponent)

describe('MyComponent', () =&gt; {

  it('renders the correct message', () =&gt; {
    expect(wrapper.text()).toBe('Hello #GlasgowJS!')
  })
})
```

# Tests didn't reflect how users were using the app

## Cypress: end-to-end testing through *enough* browser automation

![Default-aligned image](cypress.png)

---

# Example Application (w/ StimulusJS)

In ./static/app.html

```html
    <div class="content" data-controller="hello">
        <h1 class="title" data-target="hello.greeting">Hello World!</h1>

        <form data-action="submit->hello#greet">
            <input data-target="hello.name" type="text">
                
            <button>Greet!</button>
        </form>
    </div>
```

# Augment with test attributes

We use `data-test` so that we can select elements on our page without relying on structure/styling etc.

```html
    <div class="content" data-controller="hello">
        <h1 class="title" data-target="hello.greeting" 
            data-test="greeting-text">Hello World!</h1>

        <form data-action="submit->hello#greet">
            <input data-target="hello.name" type="text" 
                data-test="greeting-input">

            <button data-test="greeting-submit">Greet!</button>
        </form>
    </div>
```

---

# Write our first test

In ./cypress/integration/greeting.spec.js

```javascript
context('Greeting Application', () => {

    beforeEach(() => {
      cy.visit('/app.html')
    })
  
    it('shows the appropriate greeting text on page load', () => {
      cy.get('[data-test=greeting-text]').contains('Hello World!')
    })
})
```

# More tests = better?

```javascript
context('Greeting Application', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      cy.visit('/app.html')
    })
  
    it('shows the appropriate greeting text on page load', () => {
      cy.get('[data-test=greeting-text]').contains('Hello World!')
    })
  
    it('greets the user with their name after form submission', () => {
      // With return key
      cy.get('[data-test=greeting-input]').type('Stephen{enter}')
  
      cy.get('[data-test=greeting-text]').contains('Hello Stephen!')

      // With button click
      cy.get('[data-test=greeting-input]').type('Stephen Again')
      cy.get('[data-test=greeting-submit]').click()
  
      cy.get('[data-test=greeting-text]').contains('Hello Stephen Again!')
    })
  })
```

# Live demo

* Go to live demo, do not pass go

---

# Solving our problem

* Core of initial problem was in using the system like a user
 * Solved!
* What about build systems?
 * Who cares? Cypress is decoupled from our application. Just cares about final html
* Code review
 * Much easier for reviewer to walk through what behaviours are tested
* What about the environment?
 * Cypress 4.0 just released with more browsers supported (Edge, Firefox etc)
 * With a little setup, runs happily headlessly in CI

***Sweet bonus***: test runner interacting with DOM like a user with dev tools and time-travel step through is glorious

---

# Downsides?

* Cypress can fail in a non-intuative way
 * Debugging a shared memory exception when running in CI wasn't enjoyable
* Some expected features aren't there
 * iframes are painful to interact with - but possible
* Parallel test runs only available when using multiple build servers and Cypress Dashboard
 * Large test suites can take minutes to run
 * Still beats manual testing - just go make tea

# Bonus Example

greeting-extra.spec.js
```javascript
const viewports = [
  {
    name: 'desktop',
    width: 1400,
    height: 900
  },
  {
    name: 'tablet',
    width: 768,
    height: 1024
  },
  ...
]

viewports.forEach(viewport => {
  context(`Greeting Application on ${viewport.name}`, () => {

    beforeEach(() => {
        cy.visit('/app.html')
        cy.viewport(viewport.width, viewport.height)
      })
```
